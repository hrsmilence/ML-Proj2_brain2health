Classifying brain health status from MR images

In this project you will classify a person's cognitive health status only from an MR scan of their brain.

After you have gained first experience with MRI data during the first project, we want to go to a more difficult and relevant task in the second project. This time the problem is to diagnose a person's cognitive health status using a set of expert-labeled training images. These labels are typically acquired by performing several time-consuming neuro-psychological tests (labels: 1 = healthy, 0 = diseased). Replacing these tests with an automatically analysed MRI scan would save a considerable amount of resources.

How well can you train a machine to automatically perform the diagnosis which is typically the task of a trained human neurologist?
